# F-sync

The Fitbit-Strava connection located at strava.fitbit.com hasn't work for a long time.

I filed support tickets and was assured they were aware of the issue and would be fixing it soon.  However I eventually grew tired of having to manually upload my activities and decided to create this app instead.

Note that this does not perform all the functions that the original app allegedly performed.  The main functionally that I am interested in recreating here is the automatic uploading of activities from Fitbit -> Strava (and specifically I am focused on Runs).

This app is very much under development and I have made many assumptions; several of which are applicable to my use case, but might not be true for a broader user base.  The real hope is that Fitbit will fix their version of the app so that it works again and render this app to be an exercise in my curiosity.
